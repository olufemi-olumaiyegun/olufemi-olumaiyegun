<h3>About Me </h3>
<hr>
<p>Currently a senior in the computer science department at the University of North Texas, I am an avid programmer and totally fit the coder cliche because this is a hobby and a lifestyle for me.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I am also involved in DevOps on AWS + CISCO networking and cloud security<p>
